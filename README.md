# Rookie-Of-The-Year-Baseball
Used python to perform a statistical analysis of 'Rookie of the Year' winners in baseball.

The goals for this analysis were: 
(1) To see if winners of 'Rookie of the Year' (RY) have above average careers and 
(2) To see if there is a trend of each winner of RY being better than the previous winner.

Happily, both of these questions were answered, and have a look to see that 'Rookie of the Year' winners 
have very above average careers in baseball (Major League Baseball [MLB])

Files:
AwardsPlayers.csv - contains all the awards won by players
Batting.csv - contains all the batting statistics of players
Pitching.csv - contains all the pitching statistics of players
Baseball_Analysis.html - an html document of my analysis. This is the best option to view-only my analysis.
Baseball_Analysis.ipynb - an IPython (Jupyter) notebook file of my analysis. Feel free to play around with things.
Baseball_Analysis.py - a python file of my analysis. Have fun coming up with your own metrics if you wish.

Note: If you download either the .ipynb or .py, you will not be able to load the data directly.
      You will need to alter the "pd.read_csv" statements at the top of the file to load the data.
